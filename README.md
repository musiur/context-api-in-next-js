# Context API in NextJS

- Hello there! This is Musiur and I have implemented Context  API in next js...which will give you the ability to switch them from dark to light and vice verca.

- I have implemented it because I have been facing a problem with global state managment in React Applications.

- After implementing this, we can easily manage states among all the components from on context wrapper component.

- You may dive deep in the project stucture and explore what are over there in the implementation.

- Thank you very much for reading this.
